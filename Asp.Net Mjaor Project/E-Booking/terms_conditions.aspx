                        <p>
                            Ebooking acts as the agent to those who are promoting or otherwise providing
                            the events for which you purchase tickets, (&quot;Event Promoters&quot;) and also
                            for /Multiplexes/Theatres/Movie halls (&ldquo;Cinemas&rdquo;). Ebooking shall
                            act as a facilitator of the transaction and shall collect payments for the Event
                            Promoters and Cinemas.&nbsp;<br>

                        <p>
                            Ebooking sells tickets on behalf of Event Promoters and Cinemas, which means
                            Ebooking does not set the ticket prices or determine seating locations and therefore
                            does not control the inventory or its availability. Tickets are generally sold through
                            several distribution points, including online, Phone Centers, Retail Locations and
                            box offices. Most distribution points generally access the same ticketing system
                            and inventory.. Check out our FAQs section for more information on ticket availability.&nbsp;<br>

                            or email) after submitting payment information, or if you experience an error message
                            or service interruption after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility
                            to confirm with Ebooking Customer Service whether or not your order has been

                            When purchasing tickets on Ebooking.com, you are limited to a specified number
                            of tickets for each event/movie (also known as a &quot;ticket limit&quot;). This
                            ticket limit is posted during the purchase process and is verified with every transaction.
                            This policy is in effect to discourage unfair ticket buying practices.<br>

                            Before purchasing tickets, carefully review your booking details. Ebooking prohibits
                            exchanges or refunds after a ticket has been purchased or for lost, stolen, damaged

                            If an event/movie is canceled, and you purchased your ticket through Ebooking.com
                            or a Ebooking Phone Center, we will automatically issue you a refund to the
                            credit card that you used to purchase that ticket, unless that ticket was subsequently
                            sold using Ebooking distribution medium and the holder of the ticket will not
                            be able to physically present it for a refund. If a ticket is purchased through
                            a Ebooking Retail Location, then you may only be able to receive the refund
                            by presenting the ticket yourself to the Ebooking Retail Location where it was

                            initial attempt, Ebooking may cancel your order and may sell your tickets to
