                <p>The  cut-off time for booking varies across theatres as it is governed by them. It's  usually 1 to 2 hours before the show start time.</p>
                <h2>Any extra charges per ticket ?</h2>
                <p>Ticketplease  charges a convenince fee per ticket and service tax on the fee. 
                    Convenience  fees are charged to balance out those costs that are incurred by us for our  services. 
                    We will charge a very small amount towards the provision of services  like elaborate show timings, theatre screenings and online transaction processing.</p>
                <h2>How would I know that my tickets have been booked?</h2>
                <p>When  your booking is confirmed, an email is automatically sent to you with the  booking details. An SMS will also be sent to your mobile phone. Alternatively,  if you are a registered user you can check for your booking details on the  website. Call us on 022 33578343 for any help.</p>
                <h2>I booked tickets but didn't get the confirmation  Email/SMS? What should I do ?</h2>
                <p>If  you are a registered user, you can check for the booking details by logging on  and going to your booking history.</p>
                <h2>How will I receive my ticket?</h2>
                <p>Once  your tickets are confirmed, you get an Email and SMS. 
                    Visit the cinema any time  before the show and collect your tickets from the box office.</p>

                <h2>If I have booked tickets for someone but cannot attend the  show personally how do I ensure that he/she/they receive the tickets?</h2>
                <p>In  case you're not able to attend the show, please take a photocopy of the front  and reverse of your credit card and sign the photocopied page. This can be used  by your friends/family to pick up the tickets in your absence.</p>

                <h2>Can I cancel, exchange or replace tickets?</h2>
                <p>No.  As per Government regulations tickets once sold cannot be exhanged,cancelled or  refunded. Ticketplease will place an order for your tickets in the multiplex's  ticketing system, reducing the number of seats available for the chosen show  time. While this allows our customers with the clear benefit of guaranteed  seats, it prevents Ticketplease and our multiplex partners from reselling  tickets in the event you do not attend your chosen show time. If you have  booked tickets and cannot attend that show, you may contact the respective  multiplex to inquire about their policy for refunds and exchanges.</p>
                <h2>I booked my tickets for today instead of tomorrow. Can  these tickets be replaced?</h2>
                <p>No.  It will not be possible to replace or refund your tickets in such a situation.</p>
                <h2>Can I change my seat numbers?</h2>
                <p>No.  It will not be possible to change seat numbers once tickets have been booked.</p>
                <h2>What payment modes are available to book tickets?</h2>
                <p>We  offer various payment options like Credit Card, Debit card, Net Banking.</p>
                <h2>What is Verified by Visa (VBV)/MasterCard Secure (MSC) ?</h2>
                <p>In  order to make online transactions safe &amp; secure , Reserve Bank of India  (RBI) has passed a mandate, with effect from 1st August 2009 according to which  all online payments are required to go through an extra level of  authentication. As per the mandate, while making payments online, you will need  to enter a password as an extra level of authentication after entering your  credit /debit card details. This all-new technology for safe online  transactions is called VBV – Verified by Visa or MSC -MasterCard SecureCode.</p>
                <h2>What is the process of getting this 'Extra Password'?</h2>
                <p>To  get an 'extra' password, you need to go through a simple process wherein you  just need to log on to your bank's website, register your card for Verified by  Visa (or MasterCard SecureCode) and get your password. Different banks have  different kinds of processes for registration. So we request you to contact  your bank.</p>
                <h2>What has to be done after registering with VBV/MSC?</h2>
                <p>Now,  whenever you will pay online, you will be directed to your bank's website after  you have mentioned your credit card details on the payment page. Here, you will  be asked to enter your VBV/MSC password and after that you will be redirected  to our website for completing the entire payment process.</p>
                <h2>What is the process for American Express Cards?</h2>
                <p>In  case of American Express Cards, the process is different. For American Express  Cards, you will be asked to enter your billing address on the payment page,  which will be passed on to the bank. This technology is called AVS – Address  Verification System. The bank will verify the billing address provided by you  against the address that the bank has in its records. Be careful while  mentioning your billing address as your payment will be rejected if the billing  address doesn't match.</p>
                <h2>My card has been charged but booking has been rejected.  What should I do ?</h2>
                <p>If  the ticket has not been successfully booked, your card payment will be  reversed. This situation occurs due to network fluctuations at Cinema end and  is very rare. A refund request for the charge on your credit card will be sent  by us to the bank the same day.</p>
                <h2>How long does it take for refund to be credited to my  credit card account ?</h2>
                <p>We  send a reverse request to the bank by the end of the day. Depending on the card  issuing bank, it can sometimes take upto 2 weeks for the reversal to take  effect.</p>
               <h2>My transaction was not processed. What do I do?</h2>
                <p>We  apologize for the inconvenience. In case we are unable to trace it we will  refund any amount charged within 3 weeks.</p>

                <h2>How many days in advance can I book tickets for my desired  show?</h2>
                <p>Booking  varies from time-to-time as per the movie and cinema planning.</p>
                <h2>How will I receive a confirmation of my Advance Booking?</h2>
                <p>You  will receive a confirmation mail on your mentioned e-mail id and an SMS on your  mobile number. Please provide the same along with your original Credit Card /  Debit Card at the Cinema to receive your tickets.</p>
